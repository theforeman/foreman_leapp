module ForemanLeapp
  # Assembles the shell script out of the command remediations found in a leapp report.
  #
  # Leapp changed the way remediation commands are quoted. Up to leapp 0.21 the
  # arguments in the "context" list were already quoted by leapp itself, so they
  # were meant to be joined verbatim. Starting with leapp 0.22 the arguments are
  # reported as they are and have to be escaped by the consumer of the report.
  # See https://github.com/oamg/leapp-repository/pull/1520
  #
  # The new quoting is shipped by leapp-upgrade-el<X>toel<Y> 0.25, which is released
  # together with leapp 0.22, so the version of the leapp package tells the two
  # formats apart.
  module RemediationPlan
    # The first leapp version that reports remediation command arguments unquoted.
